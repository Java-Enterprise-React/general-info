# Environment Setup Guide

> This document provides a list of the required technologies for anyone who will be participating in Kevin Childs batch. It details why each technology is required.

<br>

## Required Technologies

The following technologies are required in order to complete this phase of the program:

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads): We'll be using Git as a version control tool during the course of this program. Not only will you use Git to track changes to your projects, but you'll also use it to collaborate with your trainer and with your fellow associates.

<br>

- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Visual Studio Code is a text editor that makes viewing and modifying code simple. Do not confuse this tool with an integrated development environment as it does not come equipped with all of the development tools you typically find in an IDE. This tool is optional, but it can be helpful if you are new to programming and wish to familiarize yourself with the syntax of the Java programming language. 

<br>

- [**DBeaver**](https://dbeaver.io/download/): DBeaver is a free, open source universal database tool that is compatible with several external data sources, PostgreSQL included. We'll use DBeaver in order to modify our databases and persist data using a simple user interface provided to us by the tool.

<br>

- [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com/downloads/): Postman is used for testing RESTful APIs. We'll use it to set up collections of tests for the RESTful APIs we design throughout the program. It can also be used to quickly test a single endpoint.

<br>



- [**Docker**](#step-10-install-docker): Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.
