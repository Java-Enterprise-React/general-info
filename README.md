## Training Daily Schedule
- 10 EST - 11 EST: Coding Challenge
    - We will have these in the morning roughly 3 times a week
    - First 30 minutes you will attempt on your own. The second 30 minutes we will present peoples attempts and try to fill in any gaps for eachother if needed
    - If there is no coding challenge that day then I will start my demo during this time
    - Have a private Github repo where you store all of these challenges so I can reference your attempts during our 1 on 1s
- 11 - 1 EST: Demo / Lecture
    - My demos will be recorded for you guys to access on RevaturePro
    - For lectures I recommend watching what I do instead of following along but really focus on what Im doing and ask as many questions as possible. 
- 1 - 2 EST: Lunch!
- 2 - 3 EST: Demo / Lecture Continued (If needed)
- 3 - 4 EST: Flash card / Study todays topics
- 4 - 5 EST: Code!
    - You will never become better at coding without doing!
    - You can use this time for project work / coding challenges / or trying to replicate what i was doing during my demo by watching the recording
- 5 - 6 EST: Self Study / Office Hours

## Assessments
- 1on1s
    - I will review your coding challenges for the week and have you walk through your code for me
    - We will also talk about any road blocks or concerns
- QC
    - Another team comes in once a week to do mock interviews. 
    - This is really testing your soft skills over the content on the previous week. 
    - QC generally occurs at the beginning of the week (Monday - Wednesday)
- Revature Pro Quiz
    - Multiple choice assesment over the previous week.
- Full Stack Projects
    - There are 3 - 4 projects throughout training that you will present that you have to meet the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for. 
    - I take these projects and deadlines seriously. It gives me an idea of how well you understood my demos

## Tips to Be Successful in this Program
- Get to know your batchmates!
    - This curriculum is very intense however you are not going through this alone. Your batchmates are the only ones that know what you are going through so it is important to create a bond and help eachother out
- I generally provide a list of questions you should know after the demo for the day. Really utilize the time for soft skills / studying to internalize those questions AT THE BARE MINIMUM. Once I go over a topic, I expect you to know it and I will most likely start utiling those terms again for demos of other topics. 
- This is NOT school
    - You are not paying us to learn this material, we are paying you to invest in yourself. The material and concepts that we will learn in this curriculum will make you a successful developer but hearing me talk about the material is not going make you magicaly understand it. Take the time to internalize the concepts in your own way. I am here to assist you, not spoon feed you.

## Absents
I do take attendance and I do expect you to be present and on time from 10AM EST - 6 EST. This curriculum is too fast paced to be missing days

## Dress Code
When you are in training with me, I dont really mind what you wear as long as it is nothig inappropriate however I do expect you to be dressed in business professional for QCs and Project Presentations
